This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: smpstrongapa02

directives:

  - _Scheduler_strong_APA_Get_highest_ready()
  - _Scheduler_strong_APA_Get_lowest_ready()
  - _Scheduler_strong_APA_Set_affinity()
  etc

concepts:

  A testsuite that would only execute efficiently 
  (task finish within the deadline if the task set is schedulable)
  on the Strong APA scheduler but not on the SMP EDF Scheduler or
  any other SMP scheduler not supporting the dislodging of tasks 
  based on affinity as described by Bradenburg et. al in :
  
  Cerqueira, Felipe & Gujarati, Arpan & Brandenburg, Bjorn. (2015).
  Linux's Processor Affinity API, Refined: Shifting Real-Time Tasks 
  Towards Higher Schedulability.
